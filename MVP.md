# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## Has the MTA demand really decreased since COVID-19?

The goal of this project is to find any decrease on the user of the Metropolitan Transit Authority subway system in New York City.

To start to see we used the **57 St - 7 Av** station data from January 2019 to May 2021. On the graphic above we can crearly see a descrease on the users around March-April 2020. Just when COVID-19 began and crearly there is not much recovery afther that.

This graphic suggest that indeed has been a signifcant decrease on the demand at least on this station. However, does not reflect the whole MTA demand during those periods. That is something to be presented on the final presentation.
