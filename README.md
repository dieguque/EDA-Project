# MTA Project

## Has the COVID-19 affected the MTA demand?

**The Department of Transportation** requested a research to know if COVID-19 affected the MTA number of users and more specifically, what lines and station has been more affected and if they were affected, see if there is any recovery in the numbers or users.


MTA data from January 2019 to May 2021 to see the drop and recovery of number of users during COVID-19. Data from the year before COVID began will help to compare if there is any decrease and recovery. ddfd

### Use of the Data
Using the MTA public data from January 2019 to May 2021 (latest available) and filtering it we will be able to find if there is any decrease on the demand in some stations, and if there has been any decrease to see if there is some recovery on the demand.
